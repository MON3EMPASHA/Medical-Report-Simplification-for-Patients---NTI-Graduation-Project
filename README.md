## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

### 1. Python Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Tesseract OCR

The application uses Tesseract for OCR functionality. Install it based on your operating system:

#### Windows:

1. Download Tesseract from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
2. Install the executable
3. Add Tesseract to your system PATH, or set the path in the code

#### macOS:

```bash
brew install tesseract
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):

```bash
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

### 3. spaCy English Model

Download the English language model for spaCy:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Installation

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

Use the automated setup script:

```bash
python setup.py
```

This will automatically:

- Install all Python dependencies
- Download the spaCy English model
- Verify the installation

### Manual Setup

1. **Clone or download the project files**
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Download spaCy model**:
   ```bash
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```
4. **Install Tesseract OCR** (see prerequisites above)

### Streamlit Cloud Deployment

The app is configured for easy deployment on Streamlit Cloud:

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/)** and click "New app"
3. **Select your forked repository** and set main file to `app.py`
4. **Deploy** - the app will automatically:
   - Install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - Install Tesseract OCR from `packages.txt`
   - Download the spaCy English model on first run
   - Work with or without spaCy (graceful fallback)

📖 **Detailed deployment guide**: See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)

#### Deployment Files

- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `packages.txt` - System packages (Tesseract OCR)
- `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit configuration
- `.streamlit/secrets.toml` - Streamlit secrets (can be empty)
- `setup.py` - Optional setup script

#### Automatic spaCy Model Installation

The app automatically attempts to install the spaCy English model when it starts up. If this fails, the app will continue to work with limited text preprocessing capabilities.

## Usage

### Running the Application

Start the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Using the Application

1. **Choose Input Type**:

   - Select "📝 Text Input" for direct text entry
   - Select "📷 Image Upload" for image-based input

2. **For Text Input**:

   - Paste your medical report text in the text area
   - Click "🚀 Simplify Medical Report"

3. **For Image Upload**:

   - Upload an image file (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF)
   - Click "🔍 Extract Text from Image" to perform OCR
   - Review the extracted text
   - Click "🚀 Simplify Medical Report"

4. **View Results**:
   - The simplified report will appear in the output section
   - Download the results using the "📥 Download Simplified Report" button

## Model Integration

The application uses a fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model with LoRA adapters for medical report simplification. The model is automatically loaded from the `medical_lora_adapters` directory.

### Model Architecture:

- **Base Model**: Google's FLAN-T5-base
- **Fine-tuning**: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters
- **Task**: Medical text simplification for patients
- **Model Files**: Located in `./medical_lora_adapters/`

### Model Loading Process:

1. **Tokenizer**: Loaded from the base FLAN-T5 model
2. **Base Model**: FLAN-T5-base with 16-bit precision
3. **LoRA Adapters**: Multiple loading strategies for compatibility:
   - Standard PEFT loading
   - Manual configuration loading
   - Direct weight loading from safetensors
4. **Fallback**: Base model if LoRA loading fails

### Model Files Required:
